# README
These are the files for my the book [Learn to Code with Fantasy
Football](https://fantasycoding.com).

If you're not familiar with Git or GitHub, no problem. Just click on the green
`Code` button and select `Download ZIP`. This will download a file called
`ltcwff-files-main.zip`.

When you unzip these (note I've dropped the `-main` and renamed the directory
just `ltcwff-files`, which you can do too) you'll see four sub-directories:
`code`, `data`, `anki`, `solutions-to-excercises`.

You don't have to do anything with these right now except know where you put
them. For example, on my mac, I have them in my home directory:

`/Users/nathanbraun/ltcwff-files`

If I were using Windows, it might look like this:

`C:\Users\nathanbraun\ltcwff-files`

Set these aside for now and we'll pick them up in chapter 2.
